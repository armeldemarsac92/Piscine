This is a shy attempt at creating an horizontal scrolling website. I know some elements are not responsive at all, I lost too much

attempting to fill the thing. The style is the structure here. I would have loved to create some left side stickyness magic but unfortunately I didn't
managed to do it by myself. The js code to handle the menu items lighting up as the site advances has been written by GPT.
