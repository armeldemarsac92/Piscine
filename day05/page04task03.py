print(l1)

#going up from the bottom of the fn, the first opération is map, which takes an iterable from a list and applies
#an opération so that each element of the list is edited without the need
#for a loop.

#so first there is the multiplication by itself for each element of the list
#and then the fn list stores each of these newly calculated elements
#in a list, for convenience we stored them in l1 to print em later on.
